This project is a work in progress.

**Rate birds** is intended to be a bird rating site, where birds are compared soley by their common name, scientific name, and their appearance. Birds will appear side-by-side in match-ups to determine their elo rating, answering the age old question "What's the best bird?".

The site will use a golang and SQL back-end to store and serve bird data. The front-end structure is still tbd, but I'm tempted by HTMX to serve simple static pages.

The goal is to containerize the application for deployment on cloud services, utilizing a fully realized CI/CD pipeline and orchestration like kubernetes.
